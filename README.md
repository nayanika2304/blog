React app using multiple micro-services and a custom event bus

Painful things:

1) Lots of duplicated code
2) Really difficult to imagine the flow of events and what properties the events should have. Testing is difficult too
3) Machine gets laggy 
4) a hue chain of events may later on break the data model
